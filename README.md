# PopChat

PopChat is a real-time messaging web app built with React, Vite, and Firebase. Designed to provide a simple and responsive chat experience, it allows users to register, log in, and exchange messages in real-time.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in securely.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Messages are updated instantly for all users.
- **Room-Based Chat**: Instead of private messaging, users can join or create "Rooms" for communication, hanging out, and collaboration. Rooms are protected with a unique server name and optional password set by the room owner.
- **Available Rooms Panel**: A section in the sidebar displays all rooms a user has entered. Users can rejoin rooms quickly or share the room name and password with others to invite them. Once the credentials are verified, users will _Pop_ right through into the chat room.
- **Responsive UI**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Lightweight**: Built with Vite for fast performance.
